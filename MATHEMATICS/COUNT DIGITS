Given a number N. Count the number of digits in N which evenly divides N.

Note :- Evenly divides means whether N is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 12
Output:
2
Explanation:
1, 2 both divide 12 evenly
Example 2:

Input:
N = 23
Output
0
Explanation:
2 and 3, none of them
divide 23 evenly



class Solution:
    def evenlyDivides (self, N):
        # code here
        n=str(N)
        count=0
        for i in n:
            if int(i)==0:
                continue
            elif N%int(i)==0:
                count+=1
        return count
