Given an integer N. You have to find the number of digits that appear in its factorial, where factorial is defined as, factorial(N) = 1*2*3*4..*N and factorial(0) = 1.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
3
Explanation:
5! is 120 so there are 3
digits in 120
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
Output:
7
Explanation:
10! is 3628800 so there are
7 digits in 3628800

    def facDigits(self,N):
        #code here
        sum1=0
        for i in range(1,N+1):
            sum1+=math.log10(i)
        return int(sum1)+1
