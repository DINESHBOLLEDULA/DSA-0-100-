Given a number N, find the number of bits that are set to 1 in its binary representation

Sample Input 0

3
4
15
10
Sample Output 0

1
4
2
Explanation 0

Test-Case 1:
The binary representation of 4 is 100. The number of 1's in the binary representation of 4 is 1.

Test-Case 2:
The binary representation of 15 is 1111. The number of 1's in the binary representation of 15 is 4.


t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    count=0
    while(n!=0):
        if (n&1)==1:
            count+=1
        n=n>>1
    print(count)
