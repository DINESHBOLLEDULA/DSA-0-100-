You are given two numbers A and B. Write a program to count the number of bits to be flipped to change the number A to the number B. Flipping a bit of a number means changing a bit from 1 to 0 or vice versa.

Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains 2 integer A and B, separated by space.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100000
0 <= N <= 109

Output Format

For each test case, print the number of bit flips required to convert A to B, separated by new line.

t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b=list(map(int,input().split()))
    count=0
    n=a^b
    while(n!=0):
        if (n&1)==1:
            count+=1
        n=n>>1
    print(count)
